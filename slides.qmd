# What is Arrow?

## What problems can you solve with Arrow?

<!-- 
Lay out the problem of having data larger than memory

Larger than memory
Multiple files
Control over data types
No need for cluster or DB ("deconstructed database")

-->

## What is Arrow?

<!--     Multi-language toolbox (high level)
 -->

## The Arrow format

<!-- 

Lift a few bits from Neal's presentation at around 3:40: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zND-Wj2XPvc

Common format + Columnar format + R bindings
  1:50 onwards in Danielle's https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O42LUmJZPx0&t=180s

-->

## Serialisation


## The arrow R package

<!-- 
How does this work in R?
  dplyr/dbplyr/etc
  5:00 onwards in Danielle's https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O42LUmJZPx0&t=180s
-->

# Arrow in R

## dplyr bindings and function bindings
<!-- at a very high level: verbs, functions, joins-->

## Demo 1

<!-- 
Tables - in-memory
        Datasets - points to files, without pulling in yet
-->

## Formats

<!-- 
Formats - Parquet, Arrow, and CSV (not here, but here's why)
-->

## Interoperability

<!-- Serialisation - interoperability; talk about DuckDB too -->

## Demo 2

<!-- 
The Arrow for R cheatsheet is intended to be an easy-to-scan introduction to the Arrow R package and Arrow data structures, with getting started sections on some of the package’s main functionality. The cheatsheet includes introductory snippets on using Arrow to read and work with larger-than-memory multi-file data sets, sending and receiving data with Flight, reading data from cloud storage without downloading the data first, and more. The Arrow for R cheatsheet also directs users to the full Arrow for R package documentation and articles and the Arrow Cookbook, both full of code examples and recipes to support users build their Arrow-based data workflows. Finally, the cheatsheet debuts one of the first uses of the hot-off-the-presses Arrow hex sticker, recently made available as part of the Apache Arrow visual identity guidance.
