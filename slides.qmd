# A Journey through Arrow in R

![](https://github.com/djnavarro/arrow-user2022/blob/main/img/arrow-hex-dark.png?raw=true){fig-align="center"}

## Arrow


> Apache Arrow is a multi-language toolbox for accelerated data interchange and processing.

## What problems can you solve with Arrow?

-   Work with larger-than-memory data and multifile datasets in R without needing to set up a cluster or database

-   Pass data between R and Python, or Arrow and DuckDB without needing to copy data

-   Do all this while using dplyr syntax and familiar R functions

-   ...and more!

## Demo 1

Now over to Jon for a demo!

## Arrow Datasets

* Similar to database connections
* Can consist of multiple files
* Data not pulled into R memory until you call `collect()`
```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(arrow)
library(dplyr)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
td <- tempfile()
dir.create(td)
write_dataset(mtcars, td, format = "csv")
open_dataset(td, format = "csv")
```


## Interoperability

* zero-copy interoperability
* pass data between R and Python
* pass data between Arrow and DuckDB

## When might we want to use this?

* Most dplyr functionality is implemented in Arrow
* Window functions not yet implemented, e.g. 

```{r, error=TRUE}
mtcars_arrow <- arrow_table(mtcars)
grouped_means <- mtcars_arrow %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  mutate(mean_cyl = mean(cyl))
```
```
Warning: window functions not currently supported in Arrow; pulling data into R
```

<!-- 
The Arrow for R cheatsheet is intended to be an easy-to-scan introduction to the Arrow R package and Arrow data structures, with getting started sections on some of the packageâ€™s main functionality. The cheatsheet includes introductory snippets on using Arrow to read and work with larger-than-memory multi-file data sets, sending and receiving data with Flight, reading data from cloud storage without downloading the data first, and more. The Arrow for R cheatsheet also directs users to the full Arrow for R package documentation and articles and the Arrow Cookbook, both full of code examples and recipes to support users build their Arrow-based data workflows. Finally, the cheatsheet debuts one of the first uses of the hot-off-the-presses Arrow hex sticker, recently made available as part of the Apache Arrow visual identity guidance.
