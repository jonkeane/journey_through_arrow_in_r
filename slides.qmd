# What is Arrow?

<!-- 
1. What is Arrow and why you might want to use it - the project, the background
	Why?
		Larger than memory
		Multiple files
		Control over data types
		No need for cluster or DB ("deconstructed database")

	Multi-language toolbox (high level)
	Serisalisation (high level)
	Columnar format	(high level)
-->

# Arrow in R

<!-- 
2. What you can do with Arrow in R
	Use dplyr syntax to manipulate datasets
		dplyr verbs
		dplyr functions
		joins
	
	[Jon section on dplyr demo]
	
-->

# Arrow Concepts

<!-- 
3. The Arrow package
	Tables vs. Datasets
		Tables - in-memory
		Datasets - points to files, without pulling in yet
		Formats - Parquet, Arrow, and CSV (not here, but here's why)
		Serialisation - interoperability; talk about DuckDB too
