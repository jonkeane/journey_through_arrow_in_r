# What is Arrow?

```{=html}
<!-- 

Lay out the problem of having data larger than memory

Lift a few bits from Neal's presentation at around 3:40: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zND-Wj2XPvc

Common format + Columnar format + R bindings
  1:50 onwards in Danielle's https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O42LUmJZPx0&t=180s

How does this work in R?
  dplyr/dbplyr/etc
  5:00 onwards in Danielle's https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O42LUmJZPx0&t=180s

1. What is Arrow and why you might want to use it - the project, the background
    Why?
        Larger than memory
        Multiple files
        Control over data types
        No need for cluster or DB ("deconstructed database")

    Multi-language toolbox (high level)
    Serisalisation (high level)
    Columnar format (high level)

```

<!-- 
2. What you can do with Arrow in R (practical)
    Use dplyr syntax to manipulate datasets
        dplyr verbs
        dplyr functions
        joins

# Arrow Concepts

```{=html}
<!-- 
3. The Arrow package
    Tables vs. Datasets
        Tables - in-memory
        Datasets - points to files, without pulling in yet
        Formats - Parquet, Arrow, and CSV (not here, but here's why)
        Serialisation - interoperability; talk about DuckDB too

<!-- 
The Arrow for R cheatsheet is intended to be an easy-to-scan introduction to the Arrow R package and Arrow data structures, with getting started sections on some of the packageâ€™s main functionality. The cheatsheet includes introductory snippets on using Arrow to read and work with larger-than-memory multi-file data sets, sending and receiving data with Flight, reading data from cloud storage without downloading the data first, and more. The Arrow for R cheatsheet also directs users to the full Arrow for R package documentation and articles and the Arrow Cookbook, both full of code examples and recipes to support users build their Arrow-based data workflows. Finally, the cheatsheet debuts one of the first uses of the hot-off-the-presses Arrow hex sticker, recently made available as part of the Apache Arrow visual identity guidance.
